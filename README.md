## Acceptance of Terms

By downloading, installing, or using Vacation Tracker ("the App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use. If you do not agree, do not use the App.

## Use of the App

The App is provided for personal, non-commercial use to help you plan and organize vacations. You agree to use the App only for its intended purpose and in compliance with applicable laws.

## User Responsibilities

You are solely responsible for the data you enter into the App, including vacation details, excursions, and packing lists. You are responsible for maintaining backups of any important data.

## Local Data Storage

All data is stored locally on your device using SQLite. The App does not create user accounts and does not transmit your personal data to external servers, except for weather forecast requests which send only geographic coordinates to the Open-Meteo API.

## Disclaimer of Warranties

The App is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of harmful components.

## Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, the developers shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of or inability to use the App, including loss of data.

## Changes to These Terms

We reserve the right to update these Terms at any time. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
